# Linear-Classifier-Testing-and-Vizualizarion

This notebook was created in order to test and vizualize the aplication of a self made linear clasifier , based on the moore-penrose pseudo inverse optimization wich reduces the mean square error of two matrices.

This project is part of my research thesis in Neuromorphci AI for my BSc in Physics Degree.
